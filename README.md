## Product Description

ArenaNet’s MMO still bangs with living-world episodes, strike missions, and WvW chaos, but the treadmill is real: daily keys, wallet sinks, endless waypoints. Scene devs answered with tools like KX Trainer’s premium overlay and the OG UnknownCheats 64-bit script bundle. This trainer cherry-picks the best bits—cursor teleport, sky-surf, stat editor, ban cloak—and wraps them in a slick neon UI you can pop mid-fight. Low footprint (sub-100 MB), no custom client, just pure memory magic.

## Installation Instructions 🚀

1. **Unpack** the trainer zip to any folder outside the game directory.
2. **Whitelist** the `.exe` in antivirus—memory hooks trigger false alarms.
3. **Launch** Guild Wars 2, log into your character.
4. **Run** the trainer as admin; wait for status “Client Hooked”.
5. Hit **F1**, flip your favourite switches, vaporise the Shatterer.
6. Before WvW or public raids, toggle **INS** to disable hooks—ArenaNet’s new teleport-detection pass loves fast bans.

*Cheat-Engine die-hards:* the bundle includes a .CT file—attach to `Gw2-64.exe`, tick boxes, go wild.

## Risk Check & Patch Support 🛡️

No trainer is ban-proof. This cloak NOPs local checks, but wallet spikes still ping ArenaNet’s servers. Stay in open-world PvE or solo instances if you want near-zero heat. Offsets auto-scan on launch (same trick the original 64-bit cheat uses), so minor patches rarely break anything. Major expansion? Expect a hotfix drop within hours.
